# About LanguagePals
The problem: UH has a second language requirement, but it is often difficult to find people to practice the language with, even though the large number of foreign students means there is a large potential pool of candidates (who might, in turn, want to practice their English).

The solution: LanguagePals will match up students who are fluent in English and need practice in a foreign language with students who are fluent in the foreign language but need practice in English. 

# About Our Team

## Charles Dickens
Hello, I am a Junior Computer Engineering student at UH Manoa with a variety of interests related to Engineering and Computer Science. Currently I am working on projects related to Data Analysis. My goals for this project are to build a user friendly application that can be used to connect people who want to share their knowledge and practice new language skills. I hope to develop skills in project management and planning, version control tools, and application design. Skills and positive attributes that I will contribute to the team include a good work ethic and attitude, leadership, and a developing knowledge of JavaScript, React, Semantic UI, Meteor, and Mongo DB.

## Nathan Onaka
I am a Junior at UH Manoa majoring in Computer Science, with interests in software design, security, and computer networking.  I picked this project because many of my friends and I are learning 2nd languages, and having an application like this would be fun and helpful to use.  While working on this project I hope to improve my time management and design skills.  My experience with teamwork and JavaScript will help us to achieve our goal of completing this application.

# Goals
Students can create a profile with the language(s) they want to practice and constraints on when they can get together with another person. A profile can be displayed as a card in a list of results of a search. Perhaps a search result for student who match with your search can look similar to bowfolios' directory page:

It can also be possible to meet virtually through Skype or some other communication app. Each user profile could have a calendar with available meeting times over specified mediums that the user maintains. Then another user could ask to set up a meeting with another user by clicking on their calendar. Maybe it could look something like fareharbors system for scheduling:

The system will also provide example “talk story” session outlines to help the meetups be productive.

# Milestone 1
This milestone started on Friday April 6th, 2018 and was completed on Thursday April 12th, 2018.

Our first milestone for the language pals app was to build a working version with the minimal features. Visit this link to the M1 Project page with the detailed issues we finished [Language Pals Milestone 1 Project](https://github.com/languagepals/languagepals/projects/1). 

What we implmented was the landing page seen here:
